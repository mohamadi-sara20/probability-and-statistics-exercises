This repo contains answers to some of the problems in chapters 11-14 of the book [Probability And Statistics For Engineers And Scientists](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/probability--statistics-for-engineers--scientists/P200000007119/9780137273546).

Exercises from chapters 8-10 are manually solvable, so they are not included here.
